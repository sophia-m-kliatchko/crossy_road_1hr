Goals and Strategy:
    For this project, I set a timer for 1hour and stopped working at exactly that time, taking the
    latest version from the prompts made in that one hour period. I used Claude Opus 4.5 for the majority 
    of the work, ran out of data, and switched to ChatGPT and Github Copilot for final touches. I went into
    it planning to give the program as much documentation to work with as possible and to be clear and direct
    about any edits I want in the game, making sure to prioritize the features that were most important to me. 

    This is my result.

Prompts:
    1. https://crossyroad.fandom.com/wiki/Crossy_Road_Wiki
    read this wiki article and watch all videos. This game is based on the classic game Frogger:
    https://frogger.fandom.com/wiki/Frogger_(video_game)
    read this article as well. Write me a code file that works in vs code in python that approximates 
    Crossy Road as closely as possible. Focus on gameplay features such as jumping, logs, scrolling 
    screen, logs, cars, etc. Visuals can be 2D but should approximate the aesthetic of the original Crossy Road. 
    Give me a complete code script that will run and be Crossy Road.

    2. modify the code to add the train signals, make logs move at variable speeds (with the range starting a 
    decent bit slower than the logs are currently moving and ending barely faster than the current log speed)
    
    3. make the train signal resemble the crossy road one, and make the logs and cars both move at variable 
    speeds and different directions on the road/track. note that every lane must have a consistent speed and
    direction, but the lanes should vary

    4. AND, make the code into a file that I can copy/paste and insert into my vs code file

    5. 1: modify the train and car graphics to reflect the direction they're going in (it should 
    look like it's facing the right direction), and make the logs at most three jumps wide. 
    2: turn the chicken with the direction of motion
    3: there should be far more grass and cars than logs, and there should be more logs than trains.

    6. I want the chicken to still look square when turning to the side, don't spawn trees immediately in the 
    way of the chicken at the start of the game, and make sure the train signals are visible and stand out 
    from the environment -- I can't see them at all. The train signal should light up and ring for a short 
    while BEFORE a train arrives.

    read this documentation and try to replicate this mechanism (don't worry about 3D aesthetics or super complex graphics)

----- At this point, Claude ran out of prompts and I switched to chatGPT ---------------
    *I gave chatGPT my most recent file of the game with the following prompt
    7. initial prompt: Write me a code file that works in vs code in python that approximates Crossy Road as closely as 
    possible. Focus on gameplay features such as jumping, logs, scrolling screen, logs, cars, etc. Visuals can be 2D but 
    should approximate the aesthetic of the original Crossy Road. Give me a complete code script that will run and be Crossy 
    Road. I am writing a crossy road clone, change the spawn distribution in the file to be: grass: 40% roads: 40% water 12% 
    trains 8%

    8. make the game scroll even if you aren't moving, and have the eagle only end the game when the game scrolls significantly 
    past the chicken. modify the chicken code to look a little more like crossy road while maintaining the style. Have the train 
    signals NOTICEABLY light up red to warn about trains.

    9. Modify the chicken avatar to look much more like crossy road. Read the following websites to assist you: 
    http://crossyroad.fandom.com/wiki/Chicken 
    https://crossyroad.fandom.com/wiki/Train
    also, Redraw the train signals entirely to LIGHT UP BRIGHT RED when a train is soon to arrive (and is passing 
    by) and be much more noticeable to the player's eye.

------- At this point my time ran out and the final version was "complete" ---------------
